# tender_descriptor
Descriptor de licitaciones mexicanas a partir de un PDF
The main goal of this project is to extract all the character strings from the technical data PDF of Technologic Equipment. These extracted strings will be used to compose future sentences that effectively highlight the key technical characteristics essential for winning tenders in Mexico. To ensure a good tender description, I had to collect all the characters of the Technical Data PDF from some engineering equipment, delete the line breaks and have only one paragraph that would be used as a first prompt for OpenA.I. adding a request to exclude specific brand names. (In a Mexican tender is not allowed mention brands). Once I have the first response, I save the information in a variable to be used as a second prompt adding a request for typing the information in future sentences. At the moment the script gets the second response, it takes it and open a new word file to add all the information collected and processed by the python script. In general, this project provides concise tender descriptions that emphasize the unique technical features of the engineering equipment from a PDF. I developed this script in my current job due to the demand of tenders descriptions that must be typed by people word for word.
